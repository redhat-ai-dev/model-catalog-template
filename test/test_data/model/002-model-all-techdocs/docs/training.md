Llama 3.2 was pretrained on up to 9 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. For the 1B and 3B Llama 3.2 models, we incorporated logits from the Llama 3.1 8B and 70B models into the pretraining stage of the model development, where outputs (logits) from these larger models were used as token-level targets. Knowledge distillation was used after pruning to recover performance. In post-training we used a similar recipe as Llama 3.1 and produced final chat models by doing several rounds of alignment on top of the pre-trained model. Each round involved Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Rejection Sampling (RS), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
